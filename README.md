## Hello! Welcome to my data analysis.

This is a project that finds the reasons for flight delays in America in 2019, based of a dataset of kaggle.

I have made you a user interface that you can use, and there are many options, so you have a variety of options to choose from. This user interface is very easy to use, but in case you don't know how to use it, I have instructions below.

## How to use the user interface
Firstly, if you want to see the dataset being cleaned, check out main.py to see how I did it.

Then, go to UI.py. This is where the user interface is. Some things that you can see is the most delayed airports, airlines, days of the week, months and so much more!

Here are all of the options for you to choose!

* 2 - See the most delayed month
      1 - The most delayed month of the year
      2 - A chart with all the months of the year
      3 - Go back
* 3 - See the most delayed day of the week
      1 - The most delayed day of the week
      2 - A chart with all the days of the week
      3 - Go back
* 4 - See the most delayed time block
      1 - The most delayed time block
      2 - A chart with all the time blocks
